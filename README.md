What did I DO?
I fixed code to see semantic HTML elements
The code now meets Accessibilty Standards
I added a header and a footer to the code, the Title was also added within the code
I made changes to the flow of the code, it follows a logical structure
I added comments within the code to describe the images used for sections
Comments were added throughout
