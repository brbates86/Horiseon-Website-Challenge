First Class Challenge
What did I DO?
<br>
I fixed and consolidated code to see semantic HTML elements.
<br>
The code meets Accessibilty Standards.
<br>
I added a header and a footer to the code, the Title was also added within the code.
<br>
I made changes to the flow of the code, it follows a logical structure.
<br>
I added comments within the code to describe the images used for sections.
<br>
Comments were added throughout.
